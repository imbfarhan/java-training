//Collections help us for efficient storage and manipulation of data in Java
//Example: Arrays can be resized, inserted, deleted elements in between the array

/* Commonly used collections in Java
 * ArrayList -> For variable size collection
 * Set -> For distinct collection
 * Stack -> LIFO structure
 * Queue -> FIFO structure
